## Assessing the structure of a data.table object

Recap:

```{r install_package, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("data.table")
```

```{r load_package, eval=FALSE}
library(data.table) # Extension of `data.frame`, CRAN v1.14.2
library(palmerpenguins) # Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) Penguin Data, CRAN v0.1.0
```

- Let's create `data.table` objects using `as.data.table()` and `data.table()`:

```{r create_datatable, eval=FALSE}
# to convert a dataframe obj to a data.table obj
(penguinsDT <- as.data.table(penguins)) 
# OR
penguinsDT

(exampleDT <- data.table(x = c(1,2), y = 4, z = c("banana", "mango")))
```

Note: `data.table` gives the col type (similar property of tibbles)!

- Using `head()` and `tail()` functions, we view the first 5 rows of the data.table object:

```{r head_DT, eval=FALSE}
head(penguinsDT)
# head(pengiunsDT, n = 3)
```

```{r tail_DT, eval=FALSE}
tail(penguinsDT)
#tail(penguinsDT, n = 3)
```

- To view the structure of the  `data.table` object, use the function `str()`.

```{r str_datatable, eval=FALSE}
str(penguinsDT)
```

And the type of the object:

```{r type_of_DT, eval=FALSE}
class(penguinsDT)
```

- To show all `data.table`s loaded:

```{r show_loaded_datatables, eval=FALSE}
tables()
```

### Sorting and ordering rows

- We will use the functions `setorder(data.table, ...)` and `order` to sort rows.
  - `-:` to sort a variable in descending order.
  
An example,

```{r ordering_rows-setorder, eval=FALSE}
setorder(penguinsDT, bill_length_mm)
penguinsDT
```

```{r ordering_rows-order, eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[order(-bill_length_mm)] #ordering in descending order
```

- Also, we can sort based on multiple columns:

```{r multiple_ordering_rows-setorder, eval=FALSE}
setorder(penguinsDT, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)
penguinsDT
```

```{r multiple_ordering_rows-order, eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[order(-island, bill_length_mm)]
penguinsDT
```


## Removing information

### Selecting rows

`DT[i,j, by]`

- `i`: on which rows?

An example:

```{r selecting_rows_eg(1), eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[3:4] #selects the 3rd and 4th rows
```

```{r selecting_rows_eg(2), eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[3:4, ] #selects the 3rd and 4th rows plus all the columns
```

Let's deselect some of the rows:

```{r selecting_rows_eg(3), eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[-(1:5)] #deselects rows 1 to 5
```

OR

```{r selecting_rows_eg(4), eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[!(1:5)] #deselects rows 1 to 5
```

- We can select the last row as follows:

```{r select_last_row, eval=FALSE}
penguinsDT[.N] #selecting the last row
```

- Let's select all rows except the last 5 rows:

```{r select_all_rows_except_last_5rows, eval=FALSE}
# select all rows except the last 5 rows
penguinsDT[1:(.N-5)]
```

- We can also select rows based on a condition fulfilled in column:

```{r select_rows_based_condition}
# select adelie species
penguinsDT[species == "Adelie"]
```

- The **helper** functions can also be used to select rows:
  - `%like%` looks for a pattern in a character or a factor vector.
  
```{r select_rows_helper_fn_like}
# select rows - island with a letter D in them
penguinsDT[island %like% "D"]
```

  - `%between%` looks for values in a closed interval [val1, val2].

```{r select_rows_helper_fn_between}
# select rows - penguins with body mass between 4000 and 5000
penguinsDT[body_mass_g %between% c(4000, 5000)]
```

### Selecting columns

`DT[i, j, by]`

- `j`: what to do? -> select columns

An example:

```{r select_cols_eg(1)}
# select island col
penguinsDT[, island]
```

Note: Character vector is returned.

```{r select_cols_eg(2)}
# select island col
penguinsDT[, "island"]
```

Note: A column is returned not a vector.

- Let's deselect column `species`:

```{r deselect_cols1}
# select all cols expect species col
penguinsDT[, -c("species")]
```

OR; 

```{r deselect_cols2}
# select all cols expect species col
penguinsDT[, !c("species")]
```

- We can also select and rename columns at the same time: `DT[, list(new_name = old_name)]`.

```{r select_and_rename_cols1}
# selects col and rename
penguinsDT[, list(island, bill_length = bill_length_mm)]
```
    
  - Instead of `list()`, we can also use `.()`. Example:
  
```{r select_and_rename_cols2}
# selects col and rename
penguinsDT[, .(island, bill_length = bill_length_mm)]
```
  
- We can do the above simultaneously. For example,

```{r multiple_Selecting_rows_cols}
# select rows, and creating new cols
penguinsDT[species == "Adelie" & 
             bill_length_mm < 50 &
             body_mass_g > 4500,
             !c("island")]
```

## Adding information

### Making new columns while preserving existing one

`DT[i, j, by]`

- `j`: what to do? -> computing new columns while preserving existing ones.
- The operator `:=` adds/updates/deletes columns following the `by` reference.

Option 1:

```{r new_cols_preserving_old_op1}
# creating new cols maintaining existing cols
penguinsDT[, propBillLength := bill_length_mm/sum(bill_length_mm)][,
                                                            propFlipperLength := flipper_length_mm/sum(flipper_length_mm)]
penguinsDT
```

Option 2: **LHS := RHS form**

```{r new_cols_preserving_old_op2}
# creating new cols maintaining existing cols
penguinsDT[, c("propBillLength","propFlipperLength") := list(
  bill_length_mm/sum(bill_length_mm), flipper_length_mm/sum(flipper_length_mm))]
penguinsDT
```

Option 3: **Functional form**

```{r new_cols_preserving_old_op3}
# creating new cols maintaining existing cols
penguinsDT[, `:=` (propBillLength = bill_length_mm/sum(bill_length_mm),                               propFlipperLength =   flipper_length_mm/sum(flipper_length_mm))
           ]
penguinsDT
```

### Making new columns while dropping existing ones

`DT[i, j, by]`
- `j`: what to do? -> computing new columns while dropping existing ones.

```{r new_cols_not_preserving_old_eg1}
# new cols
penguinsDT[, .(maxLength = pmax(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm),
               minLength = pmin(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm))]
```

Let's create a new data.table object:

```{r new_cols_not_preserving_old_eg2}
# creating new cols dropping existing cols
(newPenguinsDT <- penguinsDT[,.(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000, bill_depth_cm = bill_depth_mm/10)])
```
 
## Reducing information

### Summarising rows

`DT[i,j, by]`

- `j`: what to do? -> summarise

An example:

```{r smmarise_rows}
# creating new cols dropping existing ones
# mean of flipper length, bill length and bill depth (in mm)

penguinsDT[, .(meanFlipperLength = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T),
               meanBillLength = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T),
               meanBillDepth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T))]
```
```{r count_factor}
# count of species and islands; our sample size
penguinsDT[, .(nSamples = .N,
               nSpecies = uniqueN(species),
               nIslands = uniqueN(islands))]
```

### Summarising rows with filtering

- Let's input a condition. An example:

```{r summarise_by_filtering}
#creating new cols but filtering the data first by species -> Adelie
penguinsDT[species == "Adelie",
          .(meanFlipperLength = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T),
               meanBillLength = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T),
               meanBillDepth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T))]

penguinsDT[species =="Gentoo",] # filter data based on species -> Gentoo
```

### Grouping by one or more variables

`DT[i, j, by]`
- by: group by what? An example:

```{r group_by_col}
#finding mean grouped by species
penguinsDT[, .(meanFlipperLength = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T),
               meanBillLength = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T),
               meanBillDepth = mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T)), by = "species"]
```

```{r count_by_grouping}
# count of species by islands
penguinsDT[,.(nSamples = .N, nSpecies = uniqueN(species)), by  = .(island)]
```

```{r count_by_grouping_plus_rename}
# count of species by islands plus rename the island to islands
penguinsDT[,.(nSamples = .N, nSpecies = uniqueN(species)), by  = .(islands = island)]
```

## Combining information

### Joining two data.tables 

- Suppose we have two data.tables `x` and `y`.
  - **Inner join**: return all rows from `x` where there are matching values in y and all columns from `x` and `y`. *In case of multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned*.
 - **Full join**: return all rows and columns from both `x` and `y`.
  - **Left join**: return all rows from `x` and all columns from `x` and `y`. If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned.
  - **Right join**: return all rows from `y` and all columns from `x` and `y`. If there are multiple matches between `x` and `y`, all combinations of the matches are returned.
  - **Anti join**: return all rows from `x` where there are no matching values in `y`,keeping just columns from `x`.
  
#### Joining two data.tables - merge

`merge(x, y, by, by.x, by.y, all.x, all.y, all)`
- `x`, `y`: data.tables
- `by`: vector of shared column names in x and y
- `by.x`, by.y: vector of column names in x and y to merge
- `all.x`: logical (if TRUE consider all rows from x)
- `all.y`: logical (if TRUE consider all rows from y)
- `all`: logical (if TRUE all.x = TRUE and all.y = TRUE)

#### Joining two data.tables - `data.table` syntax

`DT[i, on]`

- `i` -> join to which data.table?
- `on` -> join key columns?

An example:


```{r join_two_DT_using_data.table_syntax}
# create two data.tables: x & y
(x <- data.table(id = c(1, 2, 4, 5, 6),x = c(45, 67, 90, 54, 8)))

(y <- data.table(id = c(1, 3, 4, 6, 6), y = c(8, 14, 19, 2, 4)))
```

- Let's join the two data.tables - inner join using base R `merge` function.

```{r inner_join_merge}
x$id
y$id

merge(x = x, y = y, by = "id")
```

- Let's do an inner join the two data.tables now using `data.table` syntax

```{r inner_join_data.table_syntax}
y[x, on = .(id), nomatch = 0]

```

- Let's do left and full join the two data.tables now using the base R `merge` function:

```{r full_join_merge}
# id of x
x$id

# id of y
y$id

# full join
merge(x = x, y = y, by = "id", all = TRUE)
```

```{r right_join_merge}
# right join
merge(x = x, y = y, by = "id", all.y = TRUE)
```

- Now, let's use the `data.table` syntax to do the full and right join:

```{r right_join_data.table_syntax}
# id of x
x$id

# id of y
y$id

# right join
x[y, on = .(id)]
```

Lastly, let's join the two data.tables - anti join using `data.table` syntax:

```{r anti_join_data.table_syntax}
# id of x
x$id

# id of y
y$id

# anti join
x[!y, on = .(id)]
```

### Keys

- With keys, no need to put the `on` argument when performing a join.
- Keys sort the `data.table` in memory by the key column(s).
- Also, multiple columns can be set and used as keys.
- Useful functions include:
  - `setkey(DT, ...)` or `setkeyv(DT, keys)`: make particular col(s) of the DT a key.
 - `haskey(DT)`: does DT have key col(s)?
 - `key(DT)`: which col of the DT is the key?
 
An example:

```{r setkey_DT}
# make x and y cols of DT x and y respectively as keys
setkey(x, id)
setkey(y, "id")
```


```{r haskey_xDT}
# a logical statement T/F 
# does x has a key?
haskey(x)
```


```{r haskey_yDT}
# does y has a key?
haskey(y)
```


```{r key_xDT}
# the col used as key in x DT
key(x)
```

```{r key_yDT}
# the col used as key in y DT
key(y)
```

- Okay, so let's a inner, right and left joins x and y:

```{r join_x_y_with_keys}
# Inner join x and y
x[y, nomatch = 0]

# Right join x and y
x[y]

# Left join x and y
y[x]
```
